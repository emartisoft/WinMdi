# WinMdi
for .NET Framework, Alternative MDI Window solution

# Info
I wanted to change the appearance of the MDI window supported by the .NET Framework. But I couldn't find enough resources. In the source that I have given the web address below (it does not contain license information), there were codes that could do this with usercontrol. I added/deleted the source code to make it the way I wanted. Here is the result. I hope it is of use to someone.
